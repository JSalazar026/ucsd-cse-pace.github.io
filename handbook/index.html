that I had as a first-year computer science student:</h1>
<h2
id="department-resources-ucsd-is-a-great-school-for-cs-i-want-to-take-advantage-of-all-the-resources-possible"><strong>Department
resources? UCSD is a great school for CS I want to take advantage of all
the resources possible!</strong></h2>
<p>UCSD has a great CS department and all the staff are super
supportive. One thing that helps a lot is to show up to office hours for
your classes and just interacting with the Professors a lot. This will
help you get more connected with the department and maybe land a few TA
spots! It will also help you get familiar with what research each Prof
is doing, which you can ask later to join their research group. This is
especially more prevalent as you go into your upper division courses,
but you should still do this for your lower div classes for practice +
potential TA spot.</p>
<p>Another thing that helps is just showing up to a lot of events and
plugging yourself into the department more so that you’re aware of all
the events and resources going on throughout the department. Like my
first year I (Peter) joined PACE (shameless plug) where I learned about
ERSP, which is basically a research program for CS students, which I’m
in right now! Stuff like PACE can provide a lot of resources for you to
learn about all the stuff going on in the department.</p>
<p>Also there are a lot of networking/job events that UCSD and/or Jacobs
School of Engineering Hosts that are for students. A lot of times there
are recruiters there just to meet and talk with you, they are interested
in getting to know you! You can ask them your questions and also get
connected with them for future jobs. It helps a lot to get to know them
in person so that they can really get to know your character beyond just
a few lines on a resume.</p>
<h1 id="advice-on-classes">Advice on Classes</h1>
<h4 id="how-do-i-plan-coursesclasses"><strong>How do I plan
courses/classes?</strong></h4>
<p>A useful tool in seeing which credits you’ve already fulfilled, which
courses you still need to take for your major, minor, college, etc., and
other degree requirements is the UCSD Degree Audit. An obvious one is
WebReg which you may already use to enroll in courses, but when trying
to visualize different versions of your course schedule, you can make
different copies and name them accordingly!</p>
<p>Another tip is to either create your own course planner or utilize
the <a
href="https://revelle.ucsd.edu/academics/academic-plans/index.html#Step-1:-Quarter-Planning-Worksh">UCSD
template</a> in something like google sheets to plan courses you’d want
to take each quarter and check them off as you go.</p>
<p>When trying to decide which courses to take, CAPEs (now SET) and
RateMyProfessor are really good resources to go to to see how much time
to dedicate to each class and which Professors are good and which ones
are not (which actually matters a lot when it comes to classes!) CAPES
has a lot of useful quantitative data like the percent of students who
recommend the course or professor, average time spent on assignments per
week, and a difficulty rating. Meanwhile, RateMyProfessor has detailed
qualitative reviews which dictate individual student’s experiences with
the professor.</p>
<p>Lastly, make sure to keep in mind your specific college GE’s, CSE
GE’s, CSE lower div reqs, and CSE upper div reqs. When all else fails,
feel free to schedule an appointment with or drop into CSE or your
respective college’s advising! You can also submit any questions you
have on the Virtual Advising Center (VAC).</p>
<h4
id="how-do-i-manage-my-time-with-all-my-classes-do-i-have-to-show-up-to-every-lecture-is-it-okay-to-skip-certain-classes"><strong>How
do I manage my time with all my classes? Do I have to show up to every
lecture? Is it okay to skip certain classes?</strong></h4>
<p>Time-management is an important skill that you’ll develop at
university but things inevitably happen throughout the quarter:
accidents, adverse weather, time conflicts, etc. Many classes in UCSD
are designed with these in mind, e.g. you can drop your lowest HW,
replace a midterm with final, etc. Use these policies to build
flexibility in your schedule in case something bad happens. At the end
of the day, UCSD classes and the course staff are there to help you, so
don’t feel afraid to reach out.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If you feel like there are too many things to do in a quarter,
consider taking one of the classes in a later quarter. Most classes are
available every quarter, and there are many other ways to be active on
campus that are not classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Managing time is at its core understanding how you feel about a
class. Consider timing how long (approximately) it took you to complete
a HW for each class you have. Then reflect whether this time is
reasonable, and reflect more generally about how you’re tackling the
material in the class.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="im-struggling-with-my-classes"><strong>I’m struggling with my
classes…</strong></h4>
<p>Attending a big lecture can feel really isolating and hard to meet
people but my biggest advice is to try and make friends and connect with
people in your classes! Teaching each other is one of the best ways to
learn and confirm your understanding of material, and you can help
others with topics you feel you deeply comprehend while getting helped
on topics you may struggle with. It’s great to learn from another
student as it provides new perspective on a problem and you can see how
other peers are thinking about concepts and problems and learn from
them. Most times, other students have been in the same place you are of
feeling confused and overwhelmed and can draw on that mindset to explain
concepts in terms that are easier to understand from a student
perspective. Plus maybe you’ll pick up a few study habits or two that
you found admirable from others!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Office hours. I cannot emphasize this enough but office hours are
literally the key to success in every CS class. The TAs and Profs are
there to HELP YOU LEARN. Show up to office hours about questions on
homework, in class, or in general any conceptual questions you have. It
may seem like a chore at first to show up and take time out of your day
to attend even MORE supplementary learning (ugh I know) but office hours
are so helpful because it’s 1-on-1 teaching where you can get help for
your specific problem!! It helps to explain your through process and
where you got stuck, and your TA/Prof is literally there to help you
work out ever nook and cranny of your problem so that you get it 100%.
They won’t judge you for not understanding stuff because that’s the
whole point of office hours! We have a lot of great LPMs on PACE that
are also TAs so I can personally vouch that they are super helpful and
nice, and will walk you through every bit of your problem that they can.
Again, cannot emphasize this enough. Show up when you can!</li>

should I get involved with student organizations? Should I go and talk

<p>Most student organizations table at library walk and going up to

library walk. If you have social media, you can also follow the
organization’s page to stay up to date with different events they are
hosting.</p>

<h2 id="internships"><strong>Internships?</strong>
<a name="Internship"></a></h2>
<p>Totally understandable to feel pressure. Take comfort in the fact
that you are exactly where you need to be in this moment, and there are
quality resources here at UCSD to help you fuel your self-discovery and
search for what’s next.</p>
<p>Here is some advice on how to get started:</p>
<h4 id="how-do-i-know-what-i-want-to-do">How do I know what I want to
do?</h4>
<p>TODO</p>
<h4 id="how-do-i-make-a-resume-if-i-dont-have-any-experience">How do I
make a resume if I don’t have any experience?</h4>

<h4
id="i-have-a-resume-how-do-i-know-if-its-good-enough-to-apply-with">I
have a resume, how do I know if it’s good enough to apply with?</h4>
<p>Have someone who is more experienced read it! Some resources for this
are club events, like Resume Reviews! ACM, WIC, and many other clubs
have this event throughout the year. You can even ask for a resume
review in the ACM or IEEE Discord servers!</p>
<p>You could also go to UGCOM office hours. You can check <a
href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/advising/undergraduate-committee-ugcom-advising-and-mentorship">here</a>
which professors are specialize in resume reviews/career advice!</p>
<p>Another option is to schedule a session with the <a
href="https://career.ucsd.edu">Career Center</a>! They have resources
for making resumes, finding job opportunities, applying to grad school,
and much more!</p>
<h4
id="so-i-have-a-resume-and-now-i-want-to-apply-for-a-job-or-research-opportunity-where-can-i-do-that">So
I have a resume, and now I want to apply for a job or research
opportunity… where can I do that?</h4>
<p>Let me introduce you to Handshake! Handshake is the main platform we
use to interact with our Career Center! It’s a place where many
part-time, full-time, on-campus and off-campus jobs and internships are
posted (and target UCSD students directly!!!) Virtual Career fairs also
take place there,too!</p>
<p>Another cool features that Handshake has is a messaging service where
you can communicate with potential employers and recruiters about
opportunities and/or get to know them better!</p>
<p>If you do not know where to start on your job search, we reccomend
turning to Handshake! You will definetely get a helping hand there!!</p>
<h4
id="i-applied-to-a-job-and-the-company-sent-me-an-email-with-an-online-assessment-what-are-my-next-steps">I
applied to a job and the company sent me an email with an online
assessment, what are my next steps?</h4>
<p>First of all, congratulations! This is a huge accomplishment in
itself! Second of all, take a deep breath because you got this!</p>
<p>Online Assessments usually are timed coding tests. They tend to test
on data structures and algorithms, which are things we mostly cover in
CSE 12, CSE 100, and CSE 101. A good place to get an practice for this
coding tests are on Leetcode and HackerRank. On both of these websites,
they have recommended problems to study for interviews. You can even
time yourself doing these to get a good idea of how the test will
feel.</p>
<p>There are two types of online assessements that we, LPMs, have seen.
There is one type, where you asynchonously take the test and your code
is autograded. Usually the company will send you an email and give you a
timeframe you need to complete the timed test in. For example, you may
have a week to take a 90 minute timed coding tests.</p>
<p>The other type of online assessment we have seen is one where the
interviewer watches you code on live on a video call. For this coding
interivew, remember that the interviewer wants to hear you explain your
thought process. It is also ok to make a mistake. Often times, in my
experience, if you make a mistake, the interviewer will point it out and
give you a chance to talk through the logic. With this, you are able to
demonstrate your problem solving skills and potentially debug the
issue!</p>
<p>Another tip for both types of online assessments is to come up with
custom test cases to test your code. This shows the interviewer that you
are a critical thinker and will help you write less buggy code/have a
deeper understanding of the problem that you are trying to solve in
general.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-i-prepare-for-a-behaviorial-interview">How do I prepare
for a behaviorial interview?</h4>
<p>For a behavioral interview, a fun idea to practice is to look up
common behaviorial interview questions and do a mock interview with your
friends. Practice using the STAR method when communicating your
experiences to help get your points across. You can also check Glassdoor
for previously asked questions! Make sure to research company website
for news and values. Usually the interviewer will ask you what you know
about the company and why you want to work there.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-some-alternatives-to-internships">What are some
alternatives to internships?</h4>
<p>Research and school opportunities are other great alternatives to
internships if you would still like to gain experience. For second
years, there are the ERSP and GEAR programs, which are year-long
programs that introduce you to research and give you some experience.
The application usually comes out in March/April and you should apply
during your first year at UCSD if you are interested.</p>
<p>For school opportunities, you can apply to be a CS tutor, SPIS
mentor, or even a Lead Peer Mentor for PACE! There are many other
engineering mentorship programs/jobs on campus. The IDEA center has
study groups which are led by students for the lower division classes,
as well as other summer programs that you can apply to mentor for.</p>
<h2 id="research"><strong>Research?</strong></h2>
<p>There are a lot of different aspects of computer science, and
research is one of them. Research is a great way to gain hands-on
experience in the computing field you’re interested in, while also
opening opportunities to interact with faculty. However, research is not
for everyone so don’t feel pressured that you have to have research
experience.</p>
<p>If you are interested in research, here is some advice on how to get
started:</p>
<h4
id="where-do-i-start-with-finding-research-opportunities"><strong>Where
do I start with finding research opportunities?</strong></h4>
<p>Research the different research projects! You can find the different
research computing topics <a
href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/research">Here</a>!</p>
<p>Find something that interests you! It is totally normal to not know
what you want to do yet. Doing research is a great way to dive into a
specific topic to see if it aligns with your long-term career goals.</p>
<p>If you are a first-year and are looking for research opportunities
for your second year, there are the ERSP and GEAR programs, which are
year-long research programs. Applications open in March/April and you
should apply during your first year at UCSD if you are interested.</p>
<h4 id="how-should-i-prepare-to-get-a-research-opportunity"><strong>How
should I prepare to get a research opportunity?</strong></h4>
<p>Make sure your Resume is up-to-date. If you are having trouble with
your resume, there are some resume tips and resources listed in the <a
href="#Internship">Internship</a> section. Remember that as a first-year
student, professors or recruiters don’t expect you to have a ton of
computing experience. You can list your high school experience, class
projects, and/or extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>Most professors recommend you read their previous research paper(s)
or just have a bit of background on their work before you speak with
them. Therefore, do some research on what research you are interested in
and find the professor in charge.</p>
<p>Once you have found the professor you are interested in doing
research for, you are ready for the next steps…</p>
<h4 id="how-do-i-get-a-research-opportunity"><strong>How do I get a
research opportunity?</strong></h4>
<p>Contact the professor in charge of the research lab you are
interested in. You can either email the professor or go to their UGCOM
office hours if they have them. When contacting the professor:</p>
<pre><code>1. Introduce yourself 
2. Why you are reaching out to them? 
    1. Why you are interested in their research?
    2. What skills can you bring to benefit the research team?  </code></pre>
<h4 id="what-happens-if-i-dont-get-a-research-opportunity"><strong>What
happens if I don’t get a research opportunity?</strong></h4>
<p>That’s okay! There are endless opportunities at UCSD, whether it is
computing-related or not.</p>
<p>You can apply to be a CSE tutor or a mentor if you are looking for
leadership experience.</p>
<p>You can also join one of the computing organizations to get some
hands-on experience at UCSD… some examples are WIC, ACM, PIB, TSE, and
so many more! There are also many other <a
href="https://studentorg.ucsd.edu/">social organizations</a> that you
could potentially join.</p>
<h2 id="personal-projects">Personal Projects</h2>
<h4
id="where-do-i-start-with-personal-projects-and-do-i-need-them-for-my-resume"><strong>Where
do I start with personal projects? And do I need them for my
resume?</strong></h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Personal projects are a good way of showing interest in CS
outside of academics. That said, you don’t need to have personal
projects on a resume but they do help in distinguishing you from other
similar candidates who took the same classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Structured project teams</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Quarterly projects through clubs</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Often with other beginners, so a good way to get first exposure to
projects! Clubs like ACM, IEEE, and WIC run these every quarter</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Hackathons</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Usually 24-48 hours long, beginner-friendly, and centered around a
theme. Any project you create at a hackathon can be expanded on
afterwards into a full fledged project, or it can go directly on a
resume. See below for a list of local ones.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Project-based classes</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>CSE 110, COGS 108</li>

can I proactively network with professionals in the computer science
industry, as a first-year student?</strong></h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There are a lot of great career fairs and networking events held
at UCSD! Feel free to show up to one and just chat with the people
there</p></li>
<li><p>Professors are also professionals in the industry! We have a lot
of amazing professors at UCSD. Although there may be a limited number of
undergrad professors for your first-year, you can hold a coffee chat or
dine with a prof! (<a
href="https://students.ucsd.edu/academics/success/dine-with-a-prof.html"
class="uri">https://students.ucsd.edu/academics/success/dine-with-a-prof.html</a>).
It also doesn’t hurt to start researching which professors that interest
you for upper division classes that you start to take. Lastly, cold
emails! A cold email is simply reaching out to a professor through email
asking them either questions, research positions, etc. Although they may
be a bit harder to approach, it never hurts to try. I know people that
have gotten research positions through cold emails!</p></li>
<li><p>Student organizations often have alumni that are still involved.
You can ask around on club Discords for advice from recent grads who are
working in industry, especially on resume review or post-graduation
plans.</p></li>
